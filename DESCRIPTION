Description: Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is an algorithm to link
    groups from multiple experimental runs by forming global protein groups
    from connected local groups. The algorithm is computationally inexpensive
    and enables the connection and analysis of lists of protein groups across
    runs needed in biomarkers studies.
