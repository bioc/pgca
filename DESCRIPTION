Description: Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is an algorithm to link
    groups from multiple experimental runs of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
    by forming global protein groups from connected groups in the individual
    runs. The algorithm is computationally inexpensive and enables the
    connection and analysis of lists of protein groups across runs needed in
    biomarkers studies.
